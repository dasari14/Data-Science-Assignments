    "1. Standard Scaling (Z-score normalization):\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferred Scenario: Standard scaling is often preferred when the features in the dataset have different units of measurement or different scales. It rescales the features so that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This scaling technique is particularly useful for algorithms that rely on the distribution of features, such as linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Min-Max Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferred Scenario: Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is preferred when we need to bound the features within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. It's especially useful when we are working with algorithms that require features to be on a similar scale, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and clustering algorithms like K-means."
